## Goal

[Dogokit Corgi](https://github.com/dogokit/dogokit-corgi) is the implementation details of [Dogokit Akita](https://github.com/dogokit/dogokit-akita). This template is optimized for the shortest time to production, but with long-term development as well.

## Getting Started

### Environment Variables

Crucially, replace "BetterAuth Secret" with a strong, randomly generated secret. Use openssl or the secret generator in the BetterAuth documentation to create a secure secret. Do not use the placeholder value in a production environment!

To use Google as a social provider, you need to get your Google credentials. You can get them by creating a new project in the Google Cloud Console.
In the Google Cloud Console > Credentials > Authorized redirect URIs, make sure to set the redirect URL to http://localhost:5173/api/auth/callback/google for local development. For production, make sure to set the redirect URL as your application domain, e.g. https://example.com/api/auth/callback/google. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.

This repo is using Neon Postgres as our database. make sure to replace the placeholder connection string with your actual Neon Postgres connection string.

### Setup Environment Variables and Compose

Copy from `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values:

```bash
cp -n .env.example .env
```

Also make sure to reconfigure the default `docker-compose.yml` port for PostgreSQL.

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

### Start Database

```bash
bun db:up
# docker compose up -d
```

### Database Migration

Migrate the database:

```bash
bun db:migrate
# prisma db migrate dev
```

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
bun dev
# react-router dev
```

Application is available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build, that will also migrate deploy and generate Prisma client:

```bash
bun run build
# bun db:migrate:deploy && bun db:gen:prod && react-router build
```
